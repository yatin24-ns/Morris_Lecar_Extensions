Morris-Lecar Biological Neuron Simulator

An interactive, Python-based simulator for exploring the dynamics of the Morris-Lecar neuron model. This tool is designed for students and researchers to visualize phase plane geometry, bifurcation theory, and biological excitability.

Features

Real-Time Phase Plane Analysis: visualize Nullclines, Vector Fields, and Fixed Point stability (Stable, Unstable, Saddle) in real-time.

Live Simulation: Click anywhere on the phase plane to launch a trajectory, or inject current pulses to trigger action potentials.

Biologically Accurate: Uses standard parameter sets (Rinzel & Ermentrout, 1989) for Class I (SNIC) and Class II (Hopf) excitability.

Transition Analysis: Includes a "Bogdanov-Takens" mode to explore the geometric transition between neuron classes.

Installation

Clone this repository or download the files.

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt


How to Run

Run the main script from your terminal:

python morris_lecar_final.py


You will be prompted to select a neuron model:

Class II (Squid Axon): Fast onset, discontinuous frequency. Best for beginners.

Class I (Mollusk): Slow onset, continuous frequency.

Bogdanov-Takens: Advanced mode for exploring bifurcations.

Controls

Current Slider: Inject constant current ($I_{app}$) to depolarize the cell.

Pulse Mag: Set the strength of the momentary stimulus.

Spike (+): Inject a positive current pulse to trigger a spike.

Rebound (-): Inject a negative current pulse to demonstrate Anode Break Excitation.

V3 Shift: (Transition Mode Only) Shift the $K^+$ nullcline to change the bifurcation topology.
