The logic for analyzing the bursting statistics (Period, Plateau, Silent Interval) was implemented using a Threshold-Based State Machine inside the main simulation loop.Here is the step-by-step breakdown of how the code extracts these metrics from the raw voltage data:1. Defining "Active" vs. "Silent" StatesTo measure durations, the code first needs to decide if the neuron is currently "firing" (on the high voltage plateau) or "resting" (silent). It uses two voltage thresholds to create hysteresis, preventing noise from triggering false events:Rising Threshold ($V > -20$ mV): If the voltage crosses above this line, the burst has started.Falling Threshold ($V < -40$ mV): If the voltage drops below this line, the burst has ended.2. The Logic Flow (Inside update function)Every time the simulation advances by a time step (dt), it checks the current voltage state[0] against these thresholds.A. Detecting the Start of a Burst (Rising Edge)When the neuron was silent (not is_high) and suddenly crosses the -20 mV threshold:State Change: The flag is_high is set to True.Calculate Silent Interval: Since the burst just started, the time since the last burst ended (t_fall) represents the Silent Interval.Silent = Current Time - t_fallCalculate Period: The time since the last burst started (t_rise) represents the full cycle length or Period.Period = Current Time - t_riseRecord Time: The variable t_rise is updated to the current simulation time to mark the start of this new cycle.B. Detecting the End of a Burst (Falling Edge)When the neuron was active (is_high) and drops below the -40 mV threshold:State Change: The flag is_high is set to False.Calculate Plateau Duration: Since the burst just ended, the time since it started (t_rise) is the Plateau Duration.Plateau = Current Time - t_riseRecord Time: The variable t_fall is updated to the current simulation time.3. Statistical Calculations (Mean & CV)As the simulation runs, lists (periods, plateaus, silents) accumulate these duration values. A helper function calc_cv computes the statistics on the fly:Mean: Simple average ($\mu$) of the collected values.CV (Coefficient of Variation): A measure of irregularity.$$CV = \frac{\text{Standard Deviation } (\sigma)}{\text{Mean } (\mu)}$$CV $\approx$ 0: Perfectly rhythmic (clock-like).CV > 0.5: Highly irregular (noisy/random).Visualizing the LogicYou can imagine the logic tracing the voltage line like this:Green Dot (Rise): Triggers calculation of the previous Silent Interval and total Period. Updates t_rise.Red Dot (Fall): Triggers calculation of the current Plateau width. Updates t_fall.

Neuronal bursting—plays a critical role in neural coding, rhythmic activity, and signal amplification across the central
nervous system. The generation of high-frequency spike clusters separated by quiescent intervals—is a signature of many 
excitable neurons, including thalamic relay, cortical pyramidal, and cerebellar neurons. The classic Morris–Lecar (ML)
model captures the essence of excitability but lacks the slow feedback necessary to explain bursting. This project develops
theoretical extensions and computationally creates a modified ML neuron model that integrates intracellular calcium 
dynamics to reproduce bursting behaviour accounting for stochasticity. It is observed to produce physiologically realistic
bursting dynamics. Using nonlinear dynamical systems approach, we couple membrane voltage and gating variables to a slow 
calcium component and a calcium-activated potassium current (IₖCa). Numerical simulations and bifurcation analysis show\
that the interaction between fast spiking and slow calcium accumulation generates known characteristic geometric bursting 
patterns. Key parameters—the calcium clearance rate (ε), calcium-activated potassium conductance (gₖCa), and noise intensity
(σ)—are found to systematically tune burst duration, inter-burst interval, and temporal coherence. This minimal yet
biologically relevant model bridges cellular neurophysiology and nonlinear dynamical theory, offering interpretable 
parameters that link calcium signaling to neural excitability and rhythmic pattern formation common in many neural 
circuits. The model provides a reproducible foundation for exploring modulated bursting in other excitable systems
and can be a framework for neural niche simulation.

## What i need to learn

1. Dynamical Systems book 
2. Kandel Books for relevance , if not then research papers that talk about the particular application of the thing i am making 
3. Izkehvich books for dynamical neuroscience , bridge between neuro and dynamic
4. A full refresher on py tools and code anim , there are many code things we need to work on as well
- animated py matplotlib for bifurcation analysis

## **Key Research Questions**

1. How do **slow calcium dynamics** transform tonic spiking into rhythmic bursting?
2. Which parameters control **burst duration** and **inter-burst intervals**?
3. How can distinct **bursting types** be generated by tuning physiological parameters?
4. What are the **functional roles** of bursting versus tonic spiking in neural coding?
