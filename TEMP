Neuronal bursting—plays a critical role in neural coding, rhythmic activity, and signal amplification across the central
nervous system. The generation of high-frequency spike clusters separated by quiescent intervals—is a signature of many 
excitable neurons, including thalamic relay, cortical pyramidal, and cerebellar neurons. The classic Morris–Lecar (ML)
model captures the essence of excitability but lacks the slow feedback necessary to explain bursting. This project develops
theoretical extensions and computationally creates a modified ML neuron model that integrates intracellular calcium 
dynamics to reproduce bursting behaviour accounting for stochasticity. It is observed to produce physiologically realistic
bursting dynamics. Using nonlinear dynamical systems approach, we couple membrane voltage and gating variables to a slow 
calcium component and a calcium-activated potassium current (IₖCa). Numerical simulations and bifurcation analysis show\
that the interaction between fast spiking and slow calcium accumulation generates known characteristic geometric bursting 
patterns. Key parameters—the calcium clearance rate (ε), calcium-activated potassium conductance (gₖCa), and noise intensity
(σ)—are found to systematically tune burst duration, inter-burst interval, and temporal coherence. This minimal yet
biologically relevant model bridges cellular neurophysiology and nonlinear dynamical theory, offering interpretable 
parameters that link calcium signaling to neural excitability and rhythmic pattern formation common in many neural 
circuits. The model provides a reproducible foundation for exploring modulated bursting in other excitable systems
and can be a framework for neural niche simulation.

## What i need to learn

1. Dynamical Systems book 
2. Kandel Books for relevance , if not then research papers that talk about the particular application of the thing i am making 
3. Izkehvich books for dynamical neuroscience , bridge between neuro and dynamic
4. A full refresher on py tools and code anim , there are many code things we need to work on as well
- animated py matplotlib for bifurcation analysis

## **Key Research Questions**

1. How do **slow calcium dynamics** transform tonic spiking into rhythmic bursting?
2. Which parameters control **burst duration** and **inter-burst intervals**?
3. How can distinct **bursting types** be generated by tuning physiological parameters?
4. What are the **functional roles** of bursting versus tonic spiking in neural coding?
